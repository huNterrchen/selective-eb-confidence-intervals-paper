## Reproducible code for Empirical Bayes learning from selectively reported confidence intervals

Our analysis relies on the [Empirikos.jl](https://github.com/nignatiadis/Empirikos.jl) package. While we are integrating everything into the package, please use the Empirikos package and code in the **temporary-reproducible-code** branch for reproducing the analysis in our paper.
